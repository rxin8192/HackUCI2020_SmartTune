Smart Tune is designed to be run in the background while listening to some other audio input in order to adjust the volume to match the surrounding noise. 
Smart Tune uses the microhone permission and creates a foreground service in order to access the microphone while running in the background.

Features a simple UI with a microphone button that will enable the volume adjustment

After a short calibration delay the application will begin to increase or decrease the volume based on fluxuations in the ambient noise level picked up by your device's microphone.

Smart Tune also features a settings page where the sensitivity and range of the volume adjustment can be changed.
