# TO DO

 * make a listener that takes mic input and creates a valid decibel value

 * IMPLEMENTATION IDEA: two global variables: default_volume, curr_increment. To calculate current volume bar, add sound_original to sound_increment. Default volume will change whenever the volume button is pressed. curr_increment will change based off of mic parsing. 

 * adjust the volume according to decibel changes

* create a loop that enables the istener and volume adjustment

* check for bugs

* look into making a background process

* polish UI
